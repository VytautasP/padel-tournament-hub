/*
 * Every string the organizer can read (decision #20).
 *
 * No template in this app writes a word of its own. That is not a translation feature — the app
 * is English-only and will stay that way — it is so that adding Transloco later is wiring rather
 * than template archaeology, and so that the whole voice of the product can be read in one file
 * and made consistent.
 *
 * Strings that need a value in the middle are functions rather than templates with a placeholder
 * to substitute, so the compiler checks that what a screen has to say is a thing it actually
 * knows. `tools/verify-app-conventions.mjs` proves no template has quietly grown a literal.
